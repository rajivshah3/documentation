# Proof of existence

**Files are important for transporting information such as contracts among different parties. Sometimes, one party may change a file without the others knowing. So, all parties need a way to reliably prove that a file has not been changed so they can trust it. The proof of existence library provides methods for using the Tangle to verify that files are unchanged.**

With the proof of existence library, you can:

- Hash a file and attach it to the Tangle to use as a single source of truth
- Get the file from the Tangle and verify that the original file is still unchanged
