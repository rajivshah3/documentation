# Channels

**Channels is a built-in [Streams](root://iota-streams/1.0/overview.md) protocol for building secure messaging applications.**

With the Channels, you can:

- Sign and encrypt messages, allowing others to verify your identity on the channel
- Publish messages on the Tangle, making them transparent and tamperproof
- Give permission to others to encrypt and decrypt messages

## Limitations

Messages are intended to be read and processed. After a message is sent, you should not rely on being able to read that message again.

## Roadmap

Channels is in the alpha phase of the release cycle. The purpose of this version is to get some feedback before we progress towards the final implementation.

See the [roadmap](https://roadmap.iota.org/masked-authenticated-messaging-v1_1) for more information.
