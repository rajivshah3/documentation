# Verify your Trinity Desktop download

**When you download Trinity Desktop, you may want to verify its authenticity to make sure that you downloaded the correct one from the IOTA Foundation GitHub repository.**

To verify the authenticity of Trinity Desktop, you can use the SHA256 hash and code signature. Instructions for both of these steps differ, depending on your operating system.

## Windows operating system

### Verify the SHA256 hash

1. Open a command prompt

2. Create a SHA256 hash of the Trinity Desktop `.exe` file. Replace the path with the path to your Trinity `.exe` file.

    ```
    certUtil -hashfile path\to\trinity-desktop-version.exe SHA256
    ```
  
    For example, if the file is in the `C:\Users\yourname\Downloads` directory, do the following:
  
    ```
    certUtil -hashfile C:\Users\yourname\Downloads\trinity-desktop-0.3.2.exe SHA256
    ```

3. Compare your SHA256 hash with the one in the [release notes](https://github.com/iotaledger/trinity-wallet/releases) and make sure that they match

### Verify the code signature

1. Right-click on `trinity-desktop-version.exe`

2. Go to **Digital Signatures** > **Details** > **View Certificate**

3. In the Certification Path tab, make sure that the the following information matches the path:

    * DigiCert
    * DigiCert SHA2 Assured Code Signing CA
    * IOTA Stiftung

4. Make sure that the Certificate status reads "This certificate is OK."

## MacOS operating system

### Verify the SHA256 hash

1. Open Terminal (in `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal`)

2.  Create a SHA256 hash of the Trinity Desktop `.dmg` file. Replace the path with the path to your Trinity `.dmg` file.

  ```bash
  shasum -a 256 /path/to/trinity-desktop-version.dmg
  ```

  For example, if the file is in `~/Downloads`, do the following:

  ```bash
  shasum -a 256 ~/Downloads/trinity-desktop-0.3.2.dmg
  ```

3. Compare your SHA256 hash with the one in the [release notes](https://github.com/iotaledger/trinity-wallet/releases) and make sure that they match

### Verify the code signature

#### Prerequisites

To follow these instructions you need [Xcode Command Line Tools](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/common/handouts/macmingweclipse/allexperimental/macxcodecommandlinetools.html).

1. Open Terminal (in `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal`)

2. Verify the `Trinity.app` file's signature. Replace the path with the path to your `Trinity.app` file. This command confirms whether the code binaries are actually signed, the signature is valid, all the sealed components are unaltered, and the signature passes some basic consistency checks.

    ```bash
    codesign -d -vv /path/to/Trinity.app
    ```
    
    For example, if the file is in the `/Applications` directory, do the following:
    
    ```bash
    codesign -d -vv /Applications/Trinity.app
    ```

3. Make sure that the following information matches the output of the command:

    ```bash
    Identifier=org.iota.trinity
    Authority=Developer ID Application: IOTA Stiftung (UG77RJKZHH)
    Authority=Developer ID Certification Authority
    Authority=Apple Root CA
    ```

4. Test the signature against system policies. Replace the path with the path to your `Trinity.app` file.

    ```bash
    spctl -a -vv path/to/Trinity.app
    ```

    For example, if the file is in the `/Applications` directory, do the following:
    
    ```bash
    spctl -a -vv /Applications/Trinity.app
    ```

5. Make sure that the following information matches the output of the command (assuming Trinity is in the `/Applications` directory):

    * `/Applications/Trinity.app: accepted`
    * `source=Notarized Developer ID` (note: for versions earlier than v0.6.0, this may show as `source=Developer ID`)
    * `origin=Developer ID Application: IOTA Stiftung (UG77RJKZHH)`


## Linux operating system

### Verify the SHA256 hash

#### Prerequisites

To follow these instructions you need the `sha256sum` package, which is included with most Linux distributions.

1. Open Terminal

2. Create a SHA256 hash of the Trinity Desktop executable file. Replace the path with the path to your Trinity executable file.

  ```bash
  `sha256sum path/to/trinity-desktop-version.AppImage`
  ```

  For example, if the file is in `~/Downloads`, do the following:

  ```bash
  sha256sum ~/Downloads/trinity-desktop-0.3.2.AppImage
  ```

3. Compare your SHA256 hash with the one in the [release notes](https://github.com/iotaledger/trinity-wallet/releases) and make sure that they match
  
### Verify the code signature

1. Download the .asc and .gpg files in the Assets section of the [release notes](https://github.com/iotaledger/trinity-wallet/releases)

2. Import the Trinity GPG key. Replace the path with the path to your Trinity `.gpg` file.

    ```bash
    gpg --import path/to/gpgfile
    ```
    
    For example, if the file is in the `~/Downloads` directory, do the following:
    
    ```bash
    gpg --import ~/Downloads/iota.foundation.subkey.trinity.public.gpg
    ```

3. Make sure that the following information matches the output of the command:
  
    ```bash
    gpg: key 46A440CCE5664A64: public key "IOTA Foundation (IOTA Foundation Identity) <contact@iota.org>"
    ```

4. Verify the signature

    ```bash
    gpg --verify path/to/trinity-desktop-version.AppImage.asc path/to/trinity-desktop-version.AppImage
    ```
    
    For example, if the .asc and .AppImage files are both in `~/Downloads`, do the following:
    
    ```bash
    gpg --verify ~/Downloads/trinity-desktop-0.3.2.AppImage.asc ~/Downloads/trinity-desktop-0.3.2.AppImage
    ```

5. Make sure that the following information matches the output of the command:

    ```bash
    gpg: Good signature from "IOTA Foundation (IOTA Foundation Identity) <contact@iota.org>"
    ```
