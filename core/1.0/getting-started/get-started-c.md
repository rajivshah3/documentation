# Get started with the C client library

**To help you get started with the C client library, this workflow topic walks you through the essentials from sending a zero-value transaction to transferring IOTA tokens and monitoring a node for live Tangle data.**

## What you will learn

If you complete this guide from beginning to end, you'll learn everything from generating addresses to listening for live transaction on the Tangle.
